#BluePanel

####Because a piece of paper isn't good enough.
BluePanel is a tool designed for H.B Beal secondary school to log students going into support rooms. Teachers will be able to view theese statistics via the web gui. There is a permissions system in which is outlined below. This project is open source and we invite anyone to contribute and use this amazing tool.

###Permissions System
BluePanel has three different permissions levels, each higher group inherits the permissions from the groups below it.
####Administrator
This rank allows full access to logs managment, kiosk creation, kiosk editing, user managment and kiosk permissions managment.
####User
This rank allows users to view and edit the kiosks assigned to them as well as get logs from the past week.
####Guest
This rank is the default and requires no account to use, it is accessible from a unique URL. This rank allows the user to view logs from the past day and view students currently in the kiosks.
